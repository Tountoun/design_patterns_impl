    In object oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior
to be added to an individual object, dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects
from the same class.
    Decorator can become efficient than subclassing, because an object's behavior can be augmented
without defining an  entirely new object.
