The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
It is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as
if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically.
Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.
